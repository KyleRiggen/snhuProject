## Module Eight Journal

- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    - Did some easy [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems.

- What did you do particularly well?
    - On problem one, I scored in top fifth percentile in terms of speed

- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    - On leetcode you get graded on how fast and how small your code is to solve the problem.  There is always room for improvment in terms of speed and space.

- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    - On two of the questions, I used a hashmap which hasn't been covered in class so that was challenging.  There are plenty of resources on the internet that documents C++ and its features so reading about hashmaps there was helpful.

- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    - Mastery of the C++ language and how to min/max its speed and space complexity is what leetcode problems do really well I think. So creating basic algorithms to do a task in the most efficient way is very benefitial to future work

- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    - Saving my solutions today on github allows me to come back later when I have developed my skills makes these solutions today maintable.  Then I added in commets to make them readable.  They are adaptable in a sense they cover the given test cases.  Anything beyond that we would have to test.
