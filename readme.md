## Module Eight Journal

- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  - The Gaming Room wants to push their flagship game forward by having it available on more platforms. 
- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  - I am not sure.
- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  - We were able to clearly define what the client wanted.
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  - I am not sure.
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  - We are working for the client so there isnt anything more important than what the client wants.
- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  - Understanding what the client wants then getting some pseudo code going.  Then just building it.
